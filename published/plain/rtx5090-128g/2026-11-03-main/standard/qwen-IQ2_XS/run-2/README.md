## Method

The frozen requests of `bench/prompts/standard-v1` (corpus `e75eff8b9feea04f...`) were sent over loopback HTTP, streaming, one at a time, in this order: 1 warm-up (excluded), 3 repetitions of the short, 4K and 16K prompts, and the twelve sanity checks. Prompt and decode speed are the engine's own `timings`; time to first token is the client's monotonic clock from dispatch to the first nonempty reasoning, answer or tool-call delta. No request was retried. Time after the model loaded: 0 min 47 s.

## Results

| Case | Prompt tok/s | Decode tok/s | TTFT s | First answer s | Total s | Capped |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| short | n/a | 265.2 (252.2-266.1) n=3 | 0.32 (0.26-0.33) n=3 | 0.92 (0.77-0.96) n=3 | 1.7 (1.5-1.7) n=3 | 0/3 |
| prompt-4k | 4792.2 (4780.4-5061.8) n=3 | 222.9 (220.0-246.3) n=3 | 0.87 (0.82-0.87) n=3 | 2.27 (1.83-2.72) n=2 | 3.1 (2.7-3.2) n=3 | 2/3 |
| prompt-16k | 6711.6 (6703.3-6730.3) n=3 | 224.4 (220.5-240.2) n=3 | 2.46 (2.45-2.46) n=3 | 4.17 (4.17-4.17) n=1 | 4.7 (4.6-4.8) n=3 | 3/3 |

Cells are median (min-max) n=samples. Short is a prompt of about 80 tokens: its prompt rate is dominated by the fixed cost of a request, so it is not shown; read prompt speed from prompt-4k and prompt-16k. Capped = requests that reached the 512-token cap, reasoning and answer together. A capped request's total time is the time to the cap, not to an answer, and it has no first-answer time when it was still reasoning.

| Phase | Planned | Completed | Truncated | Failed | Skipped |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| warmup | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| performance | 9 | 4 | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| sanity | 12 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| concurrency | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Sanity checks: **11 of 12**.

| Case | Result | Reason |

## Failures, exclusions and limitations

- No request failed.
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-16k-r1: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-16k-r3: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-4k-r3: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Prompt-prefix reuse is the shared template prefix only; the cache was not emptied between requests, and the expert cache stays warm and evolves. These are not cold-model measurements.
- Output caps include reasoning; a request that reaches its cap is `truncated` and fails its sanity check.
- The runner cannot see other programs on the machine, the repeat-stop and loop-recovery switches of the server, or the quantization repository's revision; see `missing` in results.json for every value it could not read.
- The server had answered 1 request(s) before this run.
