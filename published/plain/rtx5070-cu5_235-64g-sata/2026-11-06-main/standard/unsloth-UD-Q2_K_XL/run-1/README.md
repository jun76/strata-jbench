## Method

The frozen requests of `bench/prompts/standard-v1` (corpus `e75eff8b9feea04f...`) were sent over loopback HTTP, streaming, one at a time, in this order: 1 warm-up (excluded), 3 repetitions of the short, 4K and 16K prompts, and the twelve sanity checks. Prompt and decode speed are the engine's own `timings`; time to first token is the client's monotonic clock from dispatch to the first nonempty reasoning, answer or tool-call delta. No request was retried. Time after the model loaded: 2 min 2 s.

## Results

| Case | Prompt tok/s | Decode tok/s | TTFT s | First answer s | Total s | Capped |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| short | n/a | 69.8 (67.5-77.4) n=3 | 0.58 (0.47-0.61) n=3 | 1.97 (1.28-2.20) n=3 | 4.6 (4.4-5.6) n=3 | 0/3 |
| prompt-4k | 2192.3 (2133.4-2281.2) n=3 | 69.7 (68.9-70.1) n=3 | 1.89 (1.82-1.94) n=3 | 6.45 (6.37-8.05) n=3 | 9.2 (9.2-9.2) n=3 | 3/3 |
| prompt-16k | 2516.4 (2503.1-2524.3) n=3 | 69.2 (69.1-77.2) n=3 | 6.54 (6.52-6.58) n=3 | 10.06 (9.05-11.07) n=2 | 13.9 (13.2-14.0) n=3 | 3/3 |

Cells are median (min-max) n=samples. Short is a prompt of about 80 tokens: its prompt rate is dominated by the fixed cost of a request, so it is not shown; read prompt speed from prompt-4k and prompt-16k. Capped = requests that reached the 512-token cap, reasoning and answer together. A capped request's total time is the time to the cap, not to an answer, and it has no first-answer time when it was still reasoning.

| Phase | Planned | Completed | Truncated | Failed | Skipped |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

## Failures, exclusions and limitations

- No request failed.
- Excluded from speed summaries: performance-prompt-16k-r3: first_answer_s is not available for this request
- Prompt-prefix reuse is the shared template prefix only; the cache was not emptied between requests, and the expert cache stays warm and evolves. These are not cold-model measurements.
- Output caps include reasoning; a request that reaches its cap is `truncated` and fails its sanity check.
- The runner cannot see other programs on the machine, the repeat-stop and loop-recovery switches of the server, or the quantization repository's revision; see `missing` in results.json for every value it could not read.
- The server had answered 1 request(s) before this run.
